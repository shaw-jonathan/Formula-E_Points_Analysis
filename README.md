# Formula-E Points Analysis

Points are awarded to the top ten drivers using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The driver securing the pole position is also awarded 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) additionally receives 1 point (2 points during the 2014 and 2015 seasons). In addition, for season six and seven (2019 and 2020) the driver achieving the fastest lap during group qualifying was awarded 1 point. The championship consists of both a drivers' and teams' championship. A driver's end of season total is made up of a driver's best results. A team's total is made up by counting both drivers' scores throughout the season.

The FIA system of points awarded has been constantly modified and updated since the first Formula 1 season in 1950. This system has been in use and modified to be utilized in all FIA competitions including but not limited to Formula 2, Formula 3, Karting World Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Rally Championship, and Formula E.

The goal of this workbook is to examine and analysis the existing and past FIA system of points in Formula E over the then (10) full seasons and to compare other FIA championships throughout history.
